TERMS OF SERVICE
Respect the participants (interviewers and interviewees) in this corpus and respect the mission of the corpus, namely to document and ultimately legitimize multilingual speech practices. Users are accordingly obliged to be mindful of how their engagement with the corpus (in classrooms, conference presentations, and publications) will ultimately reflect on the speakers and their languages. In particular, users should avoid disparaging comments and evaluations of language use(rs) that reinforce harmful, illegitimate prescriptive language ideologies.

Maintain the confidentiality of interviewers and interviewees. While the MuHSiC research team has completed a protocol of removing personally identifiable information from speech recordings, the use of pseudonyms or codes is advised when presenting, publishing, or otherwise disseminating scholarship using the corpus.

Cite the corpus using the format appearing above when presenting, publishing, or otherwise disseminating scholarship involving the corpus. Citing the corpus facilitates more researchers learning about and accessing the corpus in the future. 

Kindly share research products (presentations, papers, etc.) using the corpus with the MuHSiC PIs, so that we may include these products on the website.
